    "The Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem I am exploring is related to the mental health recovery system in the U.S. and whether it is helping those who are struggling with their mental health. When those who are struggling need serious and urgent care, they are typically hospitalized in order to save their lives and sometimes after the patients have been discharged, they are readmitted for placing their health at risk for a second time. One way that mental health programs on a state-wide or national level measure their efficacy is by looking at those readmission rates and seeing whether their program had possibly helped bring them down. This is because if the patient had not been readmitted for the effects of their mental illness, then the treatment they were seeking, a treatment that may have been provided by the program, is helping them recover. The dataset I chose is specific in which mental health initiative and location it is studying.\n",

    "Justification and Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental illness is a tough issue to tackle with the most serious of consequences. According to the National Alliance of Mental Illness, around 12.5% of visits to emergency department are related to mental illness and suicide is one of the top ten causes of death in the U.S. It is important to make our recovery systems robust and ready for those who are the most at risk, because they are people who deserve to have a safe and healthy life.\n",
    "file:///C:/Users/manas/Downloads/HQ_vol10_no2_Madi.pdf (emphasizes the importance of studying readmission rates)\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are mental health initiatives effective in reducing readmission rates?\n",
    "Subquestions:\n",
    "Can we see if there is a significant change in readmission rates between the beginning of the dataset and the end?\n",
    "Are readmission rates important in evaluating our health care systems?\n",
    "Are they a good indicator of the \n",
    "It is always important to assess the effectiveness of a program designed to change behavior, especially when it concerns a person's life. Mental health services are given the complex task of helping those with a variety of different mental illness or experiences and part of helping is making sure that they are safe and healthy. Hospitilization is a sign that those people do not feel safe nor healthy and have gotten to a life threatening point in their mental health journey. It is crucial for the mental health system to help all of those people because they are in danger. However, if the systems in place to help them are not effective, then the patients are still in danger and will not have anyone there to make sure they are taken care of.\n",

    "The main purpose for this dataset as provided by the BHO is to measure the effect of the mental health services being given in New York during the onset of the first phase of a BHO initiative which had ended in 2015 or the year after this data's initial collection. This means the entire dataset took place during a specific phase of a statewide mental health initiative and can help measure the effect the BHO initiative had on the readmission rates. \n",
